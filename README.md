My project is a Music Player that I created to practice coding with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It lets you play music and includes basic features you'd find in a regular music player. You can choose songs from the playlist, and to create a playlist, all you need to do is create a new folder in your computer with the songs you want to add, along with a cover image for your playlist and a JSON file containing the title and description of the playlist. It also features a seek bar and buttons to control the flow of music. The song list updates automatically when you select a playlist. Now, I'm looking to make it even cooler by adding more features and enhancing its appearance. It may not be much, but I believe it's not bad for a beginner-level project.
